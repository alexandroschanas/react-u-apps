## Notes for this project

---

- React components are just JS functions
- A space in return function was causing an error on returning the content
- Also used conditional rendering using {...} inside a .jsx file

---

- We removed the <header> from the App jsx, essentially creating a new component under /src/components/ , folder, creating a Header.jsx file , that will return back to the App.jsx component
